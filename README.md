# Exploring Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Description

This repository contains scripts and experiments with various Large Language Models (LLMs). Some scripts are based on Hugging Face pre-trained models such as BERT, while most of the experiments use the LangChain framework for model deployment and chaining tasks.

### Contents

1. **Hugging Face Models:**
   - Pre-trained models from Hugging Face such as BERT.
  
2. **LangChain Models:**
   - Implementation of LLMs using the LangChain framework for prompting tasks.
